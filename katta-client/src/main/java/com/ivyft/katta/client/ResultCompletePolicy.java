/**
 * Wait for the results to be fully and/or partially complete (based on number
 * of shards), the result is closed, or N msec has passed, whichever comes
 * first. The resulting ClientResult may be closed or left open, depending on
 * the shutDown setting passed to the constructor. This class does not look at
 * the results themselves (type T), it only considers the number of shards
 * reporting (with a T result, or a Throwable if an error occured) compared to
 * the total number of shards.
 * <p/>
 * If you must return in 5 seconds use new ResultCompletePolicy(5000). If you
 * want to do your own polling, use new ResultCompletePolicy(0, false). If you
 * want to wait a minimum of 3 seconds (but return sooner if results are
 * complete), then wait another 2 seconds for 95% coverage (shard based), then
 * use new ResultCompletePolicy(3000, 2000, 0.95, true).
 * <p/>
 * You could also write a custom IResultPolicy that looks inside the result
 * objects to decide how much longer to wait.
